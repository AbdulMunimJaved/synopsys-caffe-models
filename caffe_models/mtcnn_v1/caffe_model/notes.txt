MTCNN requires:
- axes order: NxCxWxH (instead of the default NxCxHxW)
- color order: RGB (instead of the default BGR)
- image should be scaled to [-1,1] (ie img = (img - 127.5) / 128)

Patched (-patched) version converted from original versions with convert.py:
- replaced PReLU with ReLU
- merged last sibling layers
- commented Softmax layer

Relu (-relu) version converted from original versions with convert-relu.py:
- replaced PReLU with ReLU

mtcnn-relu version converted from original versions with convert-mtcnn-relu.py:
- replaced PReLU with ReLU
- merged 3 graphs

mtcnn-relu version converted from original versions with convert-mtcnn.py -relu:
- replaced PReLU with ReLU
- merged last sibling layers
- commented Softmax layer
- merged graphs:
