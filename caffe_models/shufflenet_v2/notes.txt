Two different version of shufflenet_v2:

1. paddle_convert.prototxt/caffemodel: converted from paddle
2. shufflenet_v2_x0.5.prototxt/caffemodel: https://github.com/miaow1988/ShuffleNet_V2_pytorch_caffe. BN and scale layer following input data layer are removed. It is used to scale input image from [0,255] to [0,1], which could be done by pre-processing

Pruned Graphs:
1. shufflenet_v2_x0.5.prototxt / shufflenet_v2_x0.5_random_pruned.caffemodel
- random pruned (60% conv, 85% fc)
